            <h1>INTRO TO HTML</h1>
            <p>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the foundational component of the World Wide Web. It is a markup language that is used to organize the content of web pages and specify how they should be laid out and presented. The different elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, photos, links, and more, are described using a system of tags in HTML. These angle-bracketed tags are often used in conjunction with opening and closing tags to indicate the start and end of an element. HTML enables the building of forms for user input as well as the integration of multimedia elements like photographs, videos, and audio. HTML is the foundation of web development because of its straightforward yet effective syntax, which allows developers to design graphically.</p>
